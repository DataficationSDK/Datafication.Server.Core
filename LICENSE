* **“Organization”** means the legal entity using the SDK.

## 2. License Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Datafication grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable license to install and use the SDK solely for developing Applications in accordance with this Agreement.

No rights are granted except as expressly stated herein.

---

## 3. Free Use Eligibility

Licensee may use the SDK without purchasing a commercial license **only if all of the following conditions are continuously met**:

1. Fewer than five (5) Developers develop software using the SDK; and
2. The Organization's gross annual Revenue does not exceed five hundred thousand United States Dollars ($500,000 USD), measured on a calendar-year basis.

If Licensee ceases to meet **any** of the above conditions, Licensee must immediately obtain a commercial license to continue using the SDK.

### Open Source Exemption

Open source projects are exempt from developer count limits under Section 3(1), provided:

1. Total funding received by the project (including sponsorships, investments, grants, and donations) does not exceed five hundred thousand United States Dollars ($500,000 USD) annually; and
2. The project does not compete with or replicate the core functionality of the SDK.

This exemption does not modify any other terms of this Agreement, including the prohibitions in Section 6.

Exemption status is evaluated based on the project's own funding and purpose. Downstream commercial use of an exempt open source project does not affect the project's exemption status.

### Downstream Use

Use of any software that incorporates the SDK for development purposes—including integration into applications, use as a development dependency, or incorporation into software products—constitutes use of the SDK for purposes of this Agreement. This includes use of libraries or tools that internally depend on the SDK, regardless of whether the Licensee directly interfaces with SDK APIs.

Organizations whose Developers use or integrate such software must evaluate their own eligibility under Section 3, based on their own Developer count and Revenue.

End users of compiled applications are not subject to this provision.

**Safe Harbor for Unaware Downstream Users.** Organizations that unknowingly incorporate the SDK through third-party dependencies shall have thirty (30) days from written notice by Datafication to evaluate eligibility and come into compliance. This grace period applies only to good-faith unaware usage discovered through dependency chains and does not apply to Organizations that had actual knowledge of the SDK's inclusion.

---

## 4. Commercial License Requirement

A commercial license is required if **either** of the following conditions is met:

* Five (5) or more Developers develop software using the SDK; or
* The Organization's gross annual Revenue exceeds $500,000 USD.

Commercial licenses are available from Datafication LLC and may be offered on a per-developer or per-organization basis. Commercial licenses are annual subscriptions unless otherwise agreed in writing.

Failure to obtain a required commercial license constitutes a material breach of this Agreement.

---

## 5. Permitted Uses

Subject to compliance with this Agreement, Licensee may:

* Develop Applications using the SDK;
* Use the SDK for internal tools, SaaS offerings, hosted services, and on-premises software;
* Distribute Applications that include the SDK in compiled or object code form.

---

## 6. Prohibited Uses

Licensee shall not, and shall not permit others to:

* Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code of the SDK;
* Redistribute, sublicense, rent, lease, or make the SDK available as a standalone product;
* Circumvent or disable licensing restrictions;
* Use the SDK to develop or assist in the development of a competing SDK or framework;
* Use the SDK in violation of applicable laws or regulations.

No ownership rights are transferred under this Agreement. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Datafication.

Sample source code that Datafication may publish separately is not part of the SDK and may be used under its accompanying terms.
